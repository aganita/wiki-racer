# wiki-racer
## Description
Wikiracing is a game that people play on Wikipedia. Given a starting article and an ending article, the objective of a wikirace is to get from the starting article to the ending article by only clicking on links occurring in the main bodies of wikipedia articles (not including the side navigation bar or the category footer).
